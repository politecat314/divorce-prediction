# divorce probability prediction

Group project for Machine Learning course in University of Malaya. Multilayer neural network to predict the divorce probability of couples.
We group used Yöntem’s findings to construct 56 questions as divorce predictors. As we diverse some important factors of our MLP model, such as the number of hidden layers, the number of units and the regularization term, it resulted in a total of 20 tests, with the performance attained in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score is 0.88, 1.0, and 0.94, respectively.
In the context of limitations and future directions, we would like to attempt to enhance the questionnaire dataset by adding more specific questions that relate to the important factors, which could potentially contribute to the divorce occurrence, to get more clarified results and we shall also apply the data augmentation techniques.
